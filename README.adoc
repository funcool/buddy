== Introduction

_buddy_ is a complete security library for clojure. With support for:

- authentication, authorization & access rules (ring/compojure extensions)
- secure hash functions (digest)
- password hashing algorithms (bcrypt, pbkdf2, scrypt)
- message/text signing (high level interface)
- signature & authentication (mac & digital signature)
- encryption (block, stream ciphers, nonces, salts)
- key derivation functions (kdf)


Since version 0.3.0, buddy is split into four modules for improved modularity of the
application and to allow people to include only wanted parts of buddy instead of one
monolithic library.

Each module has its own functionality and its own documentation. This document/page
only serves as an introduction to the library and the content of index.

If you are happy with the monolithic version of buddy, you may want include the
"buddy" meta-package:

[source, clojure]
----
[buddy "2.0.0"]
----

In other case, see the concrete installation instructions of the module that you
need.
